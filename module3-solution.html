                <p class="item-name">Chicken</p>
                <p>The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus), a subspecies of the red junglefowl, is a type of domesticated
                     fowl, originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird. A younger
                      male may be called a cockerel; a male that has been castrated is a capon. The adult female bird is 
                      called a hen. "Chicken" was originally a term only for an immature, or at least young, bird, but thanks
                       to its usage on restaurant menus has now become the most common term for the subspecies in general,
                        especially in American English. In older sources common fowl or domestic fowl were typically used for this.

                     merely cutting into certain parts, such as roasts, short ribs or steak (filet mignon, sirloin steak,

                <p>Sushi (すし, 寿司, 鮨, pronounced [sɯɕiꜜ] or [sɯꜜɕi]) is a traditional Japanese dish of prepared
                     vinegared rice (鮨飯, sushi-meshi), usually with some sugar and salt, accompanying a variety of 
                     ingredients (ネタ, neta), such as seafood, often raw, and vegetables. Styles of sushi and its 
                     presentation vary widely, but the one key ingredient is "sushi rice", also referred to as shari
                      (しゃり), or sumeshi (酢飯).<a href="#top">(Back to Top)</a>
